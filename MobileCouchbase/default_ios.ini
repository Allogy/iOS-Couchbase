;
;  This file overrides default.ini.
;  It contains default configuration settings for Mobile Couchbase on iOS.
;
;  Application-specific configuration should go into a separate .ini file in the app bundle,
;  which can then be registered by setting the CouchbaseEmbeddedServer.iniFilePath property.
;  That file will then override the settings here.
;
;  Applications can also alter the configuration persistently at runtime by writing to the
;  server's _config URI.
